title: How Teaching Others Inspired My Own Website

It's funny how sometimes the most impactful ideas come from unexpected places. The story of this website begins with a simple question from my friend [Snigdha Thumma](https://github.com/sniggyt). She was brainstorming workshop ideas for the Girls in Tech NWA chapter and asked for my input.

As we tossed around ideas, discussing which tech skills would be most valuable for the girls, it hit me: why not teach them to create a portfolio website? I remembered a couple of friends who had set up free portfolio sites using GitHub Pages. The more I thought about it, the more it made sense. A static website could be the perfect introduction to web development for these aspiring techies.

Excited by the idea, Snigdha and I rolled up our sleeves and put together a workshop centered around HTML. We designed a 3-hour session that would take the girls on a journey from complete beginners to proud owners of their own websites. Our goal was to introduce them to the basics of web development, version control, and deployment - all in one action-packed afternoon.

When the workshop day arrived, we were blown away by the response. The room was buzzing with energy as we kicked things off. We started by introducing the girls to VS Code, watching their eyes light up as they realized they were using the same tools as professional developers. Then came the fun part - customizing a basic HTML template. It was amazing to see how quickly they grasped the concepts, eagerly tweaking colors, fonts, and icons to make their sites uniquely their own.

What really warmed our hearts was the level of parental involvement. We had expected the parents to be passive observers, but they jumped right in, working alongside their daughters, asking questions, and sharing in the excitement of each small victory. It turned into a beautiful bonding experience, with families collaborating over lines of code and design choices.

As we moved on to Git and GitHub, there were a few furrowed brows, but the girls tackled the challenge head-on. The concept of version control clicked when we likened it to saving different versions of their favorite stories. And when it was time to deploy their sites using GitHub Pages, the anticipation was palpable. The room erupted in cheers as each girl saw her website go live - their very own corner of the internet, created with their own hands.

By the end of the three hours, the sense of accomplishment was overwhelming. Every single participant had a functioning website to showcase their new creation. The feedback we received was heartwarming, with both girls and parents expressing their gratitude and excitement for what they had created.

Word of our workshop spread quickly, and before we knew it, we were asked to do an encore performance for another group. The second round was just as successful, reaffirming our belief in the power of hands-on learning and the importance of introducing girls to technology at an early age.

After guiding all these young minds through the process of creating their digital presence, I had a moment of self-reflection. Here I was, teaching others about creating a portfolio website, and yet I didn't have one myself. It was time to practice what I preached. And that's how this website came to be.

Sometimes, the best way to learn is to teach, and in teaching others, I found the inspiration to create something for myself. It's a testament to the circular nature of learning and teaching - in helping others grow, we often find new avenues for our own growth.

So here's to unexpected inspirations, to the joy of teaching, and to the endless possibilities that open up when we share our knowledge with others. Who knows what other adventures this digital journey will bring?
