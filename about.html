<h2>About</h2>

Hello World!! I am a Robotics and AI Engineer currently working at Tyson Foods Inc. I have been part of the Emerging Technology
team for 4 years. I am passionate about technology and always looking for new challenges. As part of the emerging technology team, I am 
responsible for developing and deploying applications with emerging technologies. This has translated to my life outside of work too. I love trying new activities, and
I like spending my weekends outdoors.
